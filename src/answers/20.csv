2,"There are 131 false labels out of 400. 116 of them are labeled as 0 but they should be labeled as 1. Therefore; errors are mostly belongs to class 1. Classifier is better at classifying class 0 data."
3,"After training our model(i.e obtaining implicit/ready-to-use discriminant functions g i (x) which requires covariance matrix determinant of covariance matrix mean vector and probability of each class) we try to predict label of each data sample in testing set using these models. Subsequently we compare the expected result(estimated labels of testing data) with actual data(real labels of testing data) and determine overall accuracy(# of correctly predicted samples / total # of samples)."
6,"For each testing sample from testing set (classification_test.txt) prediction was made by the discrimination function that is constructed in hw1_2.py file. The results can be observed from the output of the program along with table similar to which is provided in HW1.pdf file."
8,"I’m checking the functions for all features of al samples if which one is bigger. If g1(x) is bigger than g2(x) then its label is 0 otherwise 1."
9,"I got the predictions with “makePrediction” function. It takes feature1 and feature2 then it passes features to discriminant functions and makes prediction looking for which discriminant is larger."
15,"I have printed predicted labels on ""prediction_test.txt"" file"
16,"Discriminant functions are derived from bayes probability rule. By using this rule we synthesized two discriminant functions for our classes. Each function takes a sample as an input and make a probabilistic prediction. To decide which class a data sample belongs to we have to substitute that sample in all discriminant functions and examine the probability values generated by these functions. If the biggest probable value is generated by discriminant function of class i that sample belongs to that class. By using this bayes classifier notion I compared probability values of two discriminant functions for all samples and I decided by examining the result of this comparison which class those sample belongs to. The predictions and ground truth labels are written to the file “Classifier Predictions.txt”. This operation is performed by a piece of codes in python file “classification_results.py”. You can also see and examine the predictions with the help of this file."
17,"I stored the values of feat1 feat2 and label on 3 different list. Then calculated values of g1 and g2 compared them and stored the result in guessed label list. For the code: part2d-e.py part2d-e.txt"
19,"Each test sample is predicted according to the discriminant functions in part-c. If g 1 ( x tst) ≥ g 2 ( x tst ) and y tst = 0 it is accepted as a correct prediction or vice versa."
20,"Using Bayes discriminant functions g i (x)=p(x|ci)*p(ci) the probabilities of belonging to a class is calculated for each class’ discriminant function and these probabilities are compared to decide which class the data point belong to."
